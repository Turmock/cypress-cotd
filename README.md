# Catch of the Day

## What is it?
This is a project built along following the  [React For Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/) course by Wes Bos.

After seeing the high praise this course has received from many people, I decided to hack a crack at it seeing as I'm learning React. The styling for the course is completely provided for, only the JS was made [see starter files](https://github.com/wesbos/React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files).

## Technology / Things used
* React
* Firebase
* Localstorage
* PropTypes
* React Router

----
## Live Link
My completed live version can be found at [here](https://catchoftheday.ashleydance.co.uk/) I will be going beyond this course by styling things such as the 404 page and tweaking the CSS as the responsive aspect of the site isn't the best. ( Not done by me. )
